## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r 123190050}
library(dslabs)
data(murders)
class(murders)
str(murders)
head(murders)
murders$population
names(murders)
length(murders$population)
class(murders$population)
class(murders$state)
class(murders$region)
levels(murders$region)
mat <- matrix(1:12, 4, 3)
mat
mat[2, 3]
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
